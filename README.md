Python Calculator

In this code, we define a Calculator class that contains the four basic arithmetic operations: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide(). These methods are bound to the class and can be accessed using an instance of the Calculator class.

The main() function handles the user interaction. It creates an instance of the Calculator class and prompts the user to select an operation and enter two numbers.
